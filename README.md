# Project File Dependencies

Project managers, such as the UNIX utility make, are used to maintain large software projects made up

from many components. Users write a project file specifying which components (called tasks) depend on

others and the project manager can automatically update the components in the correct order.

Write a program that reads a project file from stdin and writes to stdout the order in which the tasks

should be performed.
